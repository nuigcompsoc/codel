# Codel

Codel is our new terminal application that will run on HAL-9000 (our new student VM). It will interface with our new REST API that will manage all containers and will do away with the need for old webspaces such as https://myuni.edu/~wiggum. These containers will not only be limited to host webapps as users will have root access to their container to do whatever they want within the bounds layed out by the CompSoc Admins and University.

Server-side has since been moved to @nuigcompsoc/webspaced
