# Codel

Codel is a new micro-service that is going to be running on HAL-9000 (our new student VM) and will do away with the need for old webspaces such as https://myuni.edu/~wiggum. It will do this by provide containerised webspaces to CompSoc members. These containers will not only be limited to host webapps as users will have root access to their container to do whatever they want within the bounds layed out by the CompSoc Admins and University.
